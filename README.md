Netflix Data Dashboard: Analyzing Viewer Preferences and Content Quality 🎬

I’m excited to share my latest project—an interactive dashboard that dives deep into Netflix's movie and TV show dataset! 🌟

📊 What’s Inside:

Distribution of Titles by Rating: A funnel chart illustrating the number of movies and TV shows across various rating groups.
Movies vs. TV Shows: Comprehensive comparison cards showing total counts, average ratings, and votes for both movies and TV shows.
Detailed Tables: A table with movie names, image posters, plots, average ratings, and votes, plus a search bar to find specific movies.
Geographic Analysis: A filled map displaying average movie ratings across different countries.
Genre Insights: A bar-line chart analyzing average ratings and the number of movies by genre.
Country-Specific Data: A table detailing the number of movies, average ratings, and votes by country.
🔍 Key Insights:

Quality Segmentation: Identifying a significant portion of highly-rated movies and a smaller segment with lower ratings, revealing trends in content quality and viewer preferences.
Content Strategy: Insights into content features that drive higher ratings and potential areas for improvement in lower-rated content.
The dashboard is designed with a sleek Netflix theme (black and red) to match the brand's style.

Feel free to explore and let me know your thoughts!
